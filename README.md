# SailScore
## Android sail racing scoring application
This application is intended for anyone running small race series, such as a small class association or sailing club. It implements Appendix A scoring rules for race series where results are entered either by finishing position or times. Finishing positions are to be used when racing within a single class and times for handicap racing.

## Development
This is a huge refactor into AndroidX using Material Components.

**Plans**
- Use Material Components, found on [material.io](https://material.io)
- Improve the UI and UX to make the app easier to use, and quick.
- Use native libraries
- Convert most of the ListViews into RecyclerViews
- Improve the file structure of the project
